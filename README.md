<h1>AgaTool</h1>
AgaTool is a powerful and customizable bookmarklet designed for enhancing your browsing experience. Originally created for the <a href="https://hackclub.github.io/hacklet/">Hacklet YSWS</a> project and as a way to explore JavaScript development, AgaTool provides a versatile toolset for quick access to utilities and websites.

## üöÄ Features

- **Customizable Multi-Tool Interface**: AgaTool allows you to open multiple draggable and resizable windows embedded directly in the webpage.
- **Session Persistence**: AgaTool saves the position, size, and content of its windows locally via `localStorage` so that you can pick up where you left off.
- **Built-in Utilities**:
  - **Notepad**: A simple text editor with auto-saving functionality.
  - **Calculator**: Quickly open a JavaScript-based calculator.
  - **Search**: Perform Bing searches directly from the tool by typing `search:<query>`.
  - **Website Viewer**: Open any URL in an iframe (though most websites, including mine, block iframe embedding).

## üìö Commands

Here are the available commands you can use in the input field:

- **`notepad`**: Opens a notepad where you can write and save notes.
- **`calculator`**: Launches a simple calculator application.
- **`ai`**: Opens the AIgaTool interface, powered by Hack Club.
- **`search:<query>`**: Search Bing for any query (e.g., `search:JavaScript tutorials`).

Please note: this only works on certain web browsers due to some having a character limit on bookmarklets (it works on my machine).
